Pty.Net is a cross platform, .NET library providing idiomatic bindings for `forkpty()`.

Pty.Net supports Linux, macOS, and Windows. On versions of windows older than 1809 the [winpty](https://github.com/rprichard/winpty) is used. For windows 1809+ this library ships a side-by-side copy of conhost.

pty bindings for .NET languages. This allows you to spawn processes connected to a pseudoterminal.

This is useful for:

- Writing a terminal emulator.
- Convincing programs that you are a terminal in order to get control sequences from their output.

Pty.Net supports Windows, MacOS, and Linux and can run on the following .NET runtimes:

- .NET 4.7.2
- .NET Standard 2.0
